Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. It is a key area of computer science research focused on developing systems that can perceive environments and make decisions to achieve specific goals. High-profile applications of AI include web search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategic game play. Many AI technologies have become so integrated into everyday applications that they are no longer recognized as AI. AI research encompasses various subfields, including learning, reasoning, and natural language processing, and utilizes a range of techniques such as neural networks and optimization methods. AI also draws from disciplines like psychology and neuroscience. The field, established in 1956, has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks, known as AI winters, but has seen significant growth since 2012 due to advancements in deep learning and neural networks. The recent AI boom, particularly in generative AI, has resulted in ethical concerns and discussions about regulation to manage potential risks and ensure beneficial outcomes.
