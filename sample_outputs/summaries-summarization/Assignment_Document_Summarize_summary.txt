The document outlines an assignment to develop an application that connects to a Google Drive folder, accesses various document formats (such as PDFs, DOCXs, and TXTs), and uses an AI model to summarize their contents. The application should authenticate with Google using OAuth2 to access a specific folder in Google Drive and list and download documents. It requires parsing text from these documents using libraries like PyMuPDF, python-docx, or pdfplumber. The summarization task is to be performed using OpenAI GPT or another AI model, with the output including the file name and a short summary of 5-10 sentences. The results should be displayed on a simple web interface using Flask or FastAPI, or alternatively, outputted to the console. The summaries should also be available for download in a CSV or PDF report and displayed in a styled HTML table with file links. Deliverables include a GitHub repository link with a README.md for setup instructions, and the code should cover Google Drive integration, document parsing, AI summarization, and output rendering.
