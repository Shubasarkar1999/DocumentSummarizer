AI.txt,"Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. It is a key area of computer science research focused on developing systems that can perceive environments and make decisions to achieve specific goals. High-profile applications of AI include web search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategic game play. Many AI technologies have become so integrated into everyday applications that they are no longer recognized as AI. AI research encompasses various subfields, including learning, reasoning, and natural language processing, and utilizes a range of techniques such as neural networks and optimization methods. AI also draws from disciplines like psychology and neuroscience. The field, established in 1956, has experienced cycles of optimism and setbacks, known as AI winters, but has seen significant growth since 2012 due to advancements in deep learning and neural networks. The recent AI boom, particularly in generative AI, has resulted in ethical concerns and discussions about regulation to manage potential risks and ensure beneficial outcomes."
Assignment_Document_Summarize.pdf,"The document outlines an assignment to develop an application that connects to a Google Drive folder, accesses various document formats (such as PDFs, DOCXs, and TXTs), and uses an AI model to summarize their contents. The application should authenticate with Google using OAuth2 to access a specific folder in Google Drive and list and download documents. It requires parsing text from these documents using libraries like PyMuPDF, python-docx, or pdfplumber. The summarization task is to be performed using OpenAI GPT or another AI model, with the output including the file name and a short summary of 5-10 sentences. The results should be displayed on a simple web interface using Flask or FastAPI, or alternatively, outputted to the console. The summaries should also be available for download in a CSV or PDF report and displayed in a styled HTML table with file links. Deliverables include a GitHub repository link with a README.md for setup instructions, and the code should cover Google Drive integration, document parsing, AI summarization, and output rendering."
