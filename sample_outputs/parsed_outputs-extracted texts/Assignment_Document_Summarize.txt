Assignment: Document Summarizer via Google Drive Integration
Objective:
Build a simple application that connects to a Google Drive folder, accesses various documents (PDFs,
DOCXs, TXTs, etc.), and uses an AI model to summarize the content of each document.
Requirements:
1. Google Drive Integration:
o Authenticate with Google using OAuth2.
o Access a specific folder in Google Drive (you can mock or hardcode folder ID for the
test).
o List and download documents (support at least .pdf, .docx, and .txt).
2. Document Parsing:
o Extract text from each document.
 Use libraries like PyMuPDF, python-docx, or pdfplumber for this step.
3. Summarization:
o Use OpenAI GPT (or another summarization model) to summarize each document.
o Output should include:
 File name
 Short summary (5-10 sentences)
4. Output Interface:
o Display results on a simple web interface (Flask or FastAPI).
o Alternatively, console output is fine for this test.
5. Download:
o Show summaries in a downloadable CSV or PDF report.
o Display summaries in a styled HTML table with file links.
Deliverables:
 GitHub repo link (include a README.md with setup steps)
 Code should include:
o Google Drive integration
o Document parsing logic
o AI summarization
o Output rendering (web/console)
